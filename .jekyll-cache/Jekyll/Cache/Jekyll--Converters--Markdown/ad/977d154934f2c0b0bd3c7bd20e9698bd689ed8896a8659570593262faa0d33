I"<p>It’s hard to think of something more at the core of society than the family dwelling. It’s where you hang your hat, put your family possessions, and spend time with the ones you are closest to. For many families in Ulaanbaatar, this means an apartment in a multi-level building.</p>

<p>As children grow up, get married, and have children (but not always in that order), families often scrape together enough money to purchase an apartment for the budding young family to start their lives together. It sounds quite idylic, something akin to a “Mongolian Dream” rivaling the American one.</p>

<p>It’s easy to argue that this Mongolian Dream is a false one, propped up by a highly profitable construction sector, but that’s not what I’m here to do. I’m here to answer a Tweet. That’s right, a Tweet. Perhaps you get motivated by lofty ideals or a sense of justice. I tend to pay attention to Twitter too much.</p>

<p>Following the Evergrande debt crisis, Bloomberg published an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-22/china-s-evergrande-debt-crisis-is-stress-test-no-one-wanted">article</a> showing the price to income ratio for various Chinese cities compared to well known cities around the world. Naturally you might wonder where Ulaanbaatar stacks up on this index?</p>

<p>First let’s define how the price to income ratio was created. The data for this chart came from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings.jsp?title=2021-mid&amp;displayColumn=0">Numbeo</a>, a living costs data aggregator. Numbeo uses a simple formula consisting of the ratio of average price per square meter and average salary. They assume a apartment size of 90 square meters and they take 1.5 times the average annual net salary as a measure of net disposable family income. This 1.5 number assumes an average of 2 earners in a family with 50% of the women participating in the workforce.</p>

<p>These assumptions might not apply well to Mongolia, but we can address these later. By having a consistent methodology we can compare all of these countries on housing affordability. Conveniently, Numbeo actually does calculate the price to income ratio for Ulaanbaatar. All put together, here is the chart from mid-2021.</p>

<p>Being towards the bottom of the chart, Ulaanbaatar does not look too bad next to the ultra expensive cities in China. But look at the two cities Ulaanbaatar is more expensive than in this list. New York and San Francisco!</p>

<h2 id="using-local-data-sources">Using Local Data Sources</h2>

<p>Let’s take a step back. How sure are we that these numbers are accurate? Using local and reliable data sources, I wanted to calculate the price to income ratio to verify that the result from Numbeo is accurate.</p>

<p>Digging around for data, there are a few issues with the index. First, it is not clear whether Numbeo is using average or median salary. In Ulaanbaatar the median salary is substantially less than the average salary. This is due to a small number of high earners skewing the distribution</p>
